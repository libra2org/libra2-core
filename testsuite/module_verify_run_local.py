# Test replay-verify by running it on a public testnet backup
# While the replay-verify composite Github Action is meant to run with libra2-core checked out in the current
# working directory, this test script is meant to be run from this separate repo. The environment variable LIBRA2_CORE_PATH
# is required to be set to the path of your local checkout of libra2-core, which will be used to build and copy over test dependencies.
